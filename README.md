Focus only on a single game
In one game you may score: 0 (love), 15, 30 and 40 points
You win a game if you:
have 40 points
win the next ball
have an advantage of 2 points
If both players have 40 points then there is a 'deuce'
Deuce: in order to be a winner you should score two points twice in succession. Otherwise, the deuce still lasts
Result: current score or who wins
